                    <p>We have a courtesy room block at Roche Harbor Resort, the wedding venue. The resort offers many different lodging options, ranging from historic hotel rooms to condominiums to houses at a variety of price points. We would highly recommend you stay at the resort; this way, you can be mere steps away from both the wedding ceremony and reception sites come Sunday! Roche Harbor's Guest Services team also provides courtesy golf carts chauffeurs to come pick you up from your resort accommodation if you don't feel like walking. </p>
                                      
                    <p>To secure room reservations at the Roche Harbor Resort, please call <a href="tel:1-360-378-2155p4">(360) 378-2155, ext. 4</a> or email <a href="mailto:groupsales@rocheharbor.com">groupsales@rocheharbor.com</a>, and use the room block code 222946. <strong>It is very important that you book your accommodations by no later than June 6, 2020!</strong> This is the room block release deadline; after this date, any open rooms in the block will be made available to the general public. Even still, we'd recommend you book your accommodations around <strong>5-7 months in advance</strong> as everything tends to book up quickly in the summer months.</p>
