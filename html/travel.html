                    <p>Traveling to our island wedding will be slightly more involved compared to a mainland wedding; however, the San Juan Islands are beautiful and the quintessential Pacific Northwest experience. We have done our best to provide the logistical information, but please do not hesitate to contact us if you need additional clarification or have any questions on how to get there.<br><br>We highly encourage guests to plan on arriving on the island by <strong>Thursday, August 6th</strong> in order to fully enjoy your trip and take advantage of everything the beautiful San Juans have to offer. Thank you so much for taking the time and effort to travel for our wedding... it truly means the world to us! We are very excited to share this magical place with you.</p>

                        <h1 style="text-align: center">Anacortes Ferry</h1>
                        <img src="images/ferry.jpg" class="image center">
                        <h3>This is probably the most popular option among locals, as well as the most cost-effective and flexible.</h3>
                        <p><strong style="padding-right: 1em">Step 1.</strong>Would it really be a Pacific Northwest wedding if a ferry wasn't involved? You will be taking the Anacortes-Friday Harbor ferry, which leaves from Anacortes, WA. Before your trip, <strong>if you plan on renting a car and driving on to the ferry, make your Anacortes-Friday Harbor ferry reservations for both to and from the island!</strong> This is very important, as spots on the ferry tend to go quickly in summer.</p>
                    
                        <p>30% of the spots are made available 2 months prior to the start of the summer season at 7 AM PST. <strong>That means June 7, 2020 at 7 AM PST (10 AM EST)— mark your calendars!</strong> The next 30% of reservation space is made available 2 weeks prior to the actual date you want to sail, and the final 30% is released 2 days prior to your desired sailing date. They reserve the remaining 10% for people on that same day on a first-come, first-served basis. It is recommended you get on to the <a href="https://secureapps.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/reservations/vehicle/SailingSchedule.aspx?cookieCheck=true">website</a> to try and reserve your spot right at 7 AM on the day in question as the reservation spots fill up quickly.</p>
                    
                        <p>Making a reservation is $10, which you are only charged if you fail to show up for your reservation without cancelling ahead of time. Friday Harbor is the last stop, though there are some express ferries where it's the only stop. See the schedule below for the different sailing times.</p>
                    
                        <p>Don't forget you will also need to purchase your actual ferry tickets for everyone in your party in addition to making a reservation, though this can be done anytime prior to sailing or at the terminal itself. <strong>If you are walking on to the ferry, you do NOT need to make a reservation. This will be the easiest, most hassle-free route! You can always rent a car on the island. See Step 3 for information on shuttles from the airport.</strong></p>

                        <p><strong style="margin-right: 1em">Step 2.</strong>Fly into Sea-Tac International Airport (SEA). If you're coming from the East Coast or Midwest, the time change will be in your favor this leg of the trip.</p>
                    
                        <p><strong style="margin-right: 1em">Step 3.</strong>Decide how to get to the Anacortes Ferry Terminal.  You can either rent a car at the airport, or you have the option of taking a shuttle from the airport directly to Anacortes, in which case you would simply walk on to the ferry; click <a href="https://www.visitsanjuans.com/members/airporter-shuttle-bellair-charters">here</a> for more information. If you want true door-to-door service, <a href="http://www.islandairporter.com/index.html">Island Airporter</a>, another shuttle company, takes it a step further and takes you from Sea-Tac International Airport directly to Roche Harbor.</p>
                    
                        <p><strong style="margin-right: 1em">Step 4.</strong>Drive about 80 miles north of Seattle (plan on a 1.5 - 2 hour car ride) to the Anacortes Ferry Terminal. We would recommend leaving in the morning if possible to avoid Seattle rush hour traffic going north. Make sure to get to the terminal about <strong>60-90 minutes early</strong> so as to not lose your reservation.

                        <p><strong style="margin-right: 1em">Step 5.</strong>Drive on to the ferry, park, and enjoy the scenic 1-hour ride to Friday Harbor on San Juan Island. Remember, if you're on a boat that stops at multiple islands, it's the last stop. Be sure to look for gorgeous views of Mount Baker to the south, and keep your eyes peeled for orcas, porpoises, and other wildlife.</p>
                    
                        <p><strong style="margin-right: 1em">Step 6.</strong>Either drive the 15 minutes to <a href="https://www.rocheharbor.com/getting-here/drive">Roche Harbor Resort</a> from Friday Harbor if you rented a car, or take a cab or shuttle.

                        <h3>A passenger-only private ferry directly from downtown Seattle for those who want a more streamlined approach.</h3>
                        <p>FYI - It's a little more expensive than the public ferry, and you will need to rent a car on the island (or be fine with relying on cabs/shuttles to get around... ride sharing apps like Uber/Lyft are unreliable on the island), and the once-a-day departure times both to and from don't leave much room for flexibility.</p>

                        <p><strong style="margin-right: 1em">Step 1.</strong>Fly into Sea-Tac International Airport (SEA). If you're coming from the East Coast or Midwest, the time change will be in your favor this leg of the trip.</p>

                        <p><strong style="margin-right: 1em">Step 2.</strong>Take an Uber/Lyft, cab, or the <a href="https://www.soundtransit.org/schedules/light-rail/link-light-rail/map">Link Light Rail</a> to downtown Seattle. Depending on the timing of your flight, you may need to stay the night in the city with this option. There are many <a href="https://www.kayak.com/Seattle-Hotels.7054.hotel.ksp">hotels</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/a/Seattle">Airbnb</a> and <a href="https://www.vrbo.com/vacation-rentals/usa/washington/puget-sound/seattle">VRBO</a> listings available.</p>

                    <p><strong style="margin-right: 1em">Step 3.</strong>Take the passenger-only <a href="https://www.clippervacations.com/seattle-san-juan-island-ferry/">San Juan Clipper</a> private ferry from their downtown Seattle terminal. During summer, the <strong>Clipper leaves at 8:15 AM</strong> every day for Friday Harbor, but unfortunately, this is the only departure time available. Departing terminal is Seattle, destination terminal is Friday Harbor. Unlike the Washington State public ferries, this ferry does not have a complex reservation system... you need only buy your tickets to save your spot.</p>

                        <p><strong style="margin-right: 1em">Step 4.</strong>Enjoy your scenic 3-hour ferry ride to Friday Harbor. Once you arrive at the ferry terminal, take a cab/shuttle to <a href="https://www.rocheharbor.com/getting-here/drive">Roche Harbor Resort</a>, or rent a car at the terminal. Click <a href="https://www.visitsanjuans.com/transportation/all-san-juan-islands/island-transportation">here</a> for some helpful suggestions on getting around the island.</p>

                        <p><strong style="margin-right: 1em">Step 5.</strong>When it comes time to leave, please note the only daily <strong>departure time from Friday Harbor is 5:15 PM, with an ETA of 8:00 PM for arriving in Seattle</strong>. Plan the next leg of your trip accordingly.</p>
